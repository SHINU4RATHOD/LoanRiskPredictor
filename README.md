# LoanRiskPredictor
Business Problem
The business problem is to accurately predict whether a loan applicant is a high risk or low risk for defaulting on a loan. This prediction is critical for financial institutions to minimize the risk of loan defaults and ensure the financial stability of their lending operations.

Business Objective
The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can predict the Risk_Flag of a client based on their financial and personal information. This model will help in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals, thereby reducing the likelihood of lending to high-risk clients and improving the overall quality of the loan portfolio.

Business Objective: 
.  Maximize Loan Approvals
.  Minimize Default Risk

Business Constraints
.   Risk Tolerance: Balance between minimizing defaults and maximizing loan approvals.
.   Cost Efficiency: Ensure that model implementation costs do not outweigh the benefits.

"in this project i have gone with diffrent predictive ML models like 
  . shallow machine learning model include (naive bayes, KNN, Decision tree)
  . Ensemble ML models like (Bagging, Random Forest, many Boosting tech like adaboost, GB, XGB)
  . Regression models like (logistic Regression)
and i have created one excel sheet there i have mention all model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score as well and compared accuracy score of all model and considerd that RandomForest as a final, i got great accuracy campared to other classification models 

Note : i have provided model model_evaluation_metrics excel sheet
